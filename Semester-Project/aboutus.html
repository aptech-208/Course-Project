                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Richfield Chairs began with a simple observation: the world is full of chairs, but very few truly
                    understand the human form. What started in a small workshop in Richfield has grown into a global
                    pursuit of ergonomic perfection.</p>
                <p>We don't just manufacture furniture; we engineer experiences. Every curve, every stitch, and every
                    material choice is made with the intention of providing lasting support for those who dream, work,
                    and rest in our seats.</p>

                    <h3>Premium Materials</h3>
                    <p>From sustainably sourced hardwoods to top-grain Italian leathers, we never compromise on the raw
                        elements.</p>

                    <h3>Ergonomic Science</h3>
                    <p>Our designs are tested against rigorous orthopedic standards to ensure your spine is always in
                        the right place.</p>

                    <h3>Timeless Design</h3>
                    <p>We avoid "fast furniture" trends. A Richfield chair is designed to look as modern in twenty years
                        as it does today.</p>

                <h2>Commitment to Earth</h2>
                <p>We believe that luxury shouldn't cost the planet. Richfield is committed to a carbon-neutral
                    manufacturing process by 2030. We use recycled alloys and ensure that for every tree used in our
                    frames, two more are planted in its place.</p>
